# JH_Completionist-Trial
A Jupiter Hell mod to add a new trial.

Always just take the same branches?
Ever feel sad about having to pick between branch rewards?
Feel the normal game is too short, but endless is too long and too repetitive?

Completion Trial. Like a normal game except you get to (and have to) visit every branch.

Visit Callisto, Europa, Io, Beyond and Dante. Fight both the Summoner and the Harbinger. Achieve every branch mechanic if you can!

Callisto, Europa and Io are all 8 levels deep. On each moon all four branches will spawn and will be 3 levels deep, and both the main branch special levels are accessible. Branches and special level is order is randomised much like a normal seed.

Normal elevators are locked if there is a branch elevator, so you have to visit every branch; though you can still and skip the special levels if you don't like fun.

## Installing

Create a mods folder in your Jupiter Hell game directory if doesn't exist then add the folder there; for Mac users, navigate to your Jupiter Hell app, right click, select "show package contents", navigate to Contents > MacOS, and put the downloaded mod folder into mods folder found there.

## Notes
* Recommended to install the new enemy mods to give you self some more variety and to help the challenge keep pace with the power you will achieve.
* Not compatible with Jovasec PDA as it can't handle the non standard branch structure (doesn't crash, just doesn't render correctly)
